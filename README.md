- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support

Requires a browser with WebGL support (most modern browsers).

## 🎨 Visual Style

The game features a retro-futuristic aesthetic with:
- Cyan/blue HUD elements with glow effects
- Dark space environment with colorful stars
- Particle effects with transparency and fade-out
- Orbitron font for a sci-fi look
- Subtle scanline overlay for retro feel

## 🔧 Development

The game is built with vanilla JavaScript and WebGL:

- `index.html` - Main game page with HUD layout
- `styles.css` - Futuristic UI styling with animations
- `engine.js` - 3D WebGL engine with shaders and rendering
- `spaceship.js` - Spaceship physics, controls, and camera
- `game.js` - Main game loop and environment generation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the game files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Wait for the loading animation to complete
4. Click to start playing and enjoy your space adventure!

## 🎯 Game Tips

- Use boost sparingly - it drains faster than normal thrust
- Monitor your hull integrity - collisions cause damage
- Use strafe controls (A/D) for precise maneuvering
- Try doing barrel rolls with the mouse for fun!
- The environment is infinite - explore in any direction

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Potential features that could be added:
- Weapon systems and combat
- Multiple spaceship types
- Missions and objectives
- Sound effects and music
- Multiplayer support
- More complex asteroid patterns
- Space stations and structures
